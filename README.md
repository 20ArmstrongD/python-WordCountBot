Hello All!

Welcome to my Word Counter Bot for discord that was made with python.

This bot was designed as a filter for people in bigger servers who violate the servers rules when it comes to language used. Made to make the server admin jobs easier when it comes to banning people. It creates 2 commands one that tracks how many times a word was used throuout the server and another that does the same thing but targets how many times a specifc user has used that word.

To get setarted with the setup refer to my [instructions.md](installation.md) to get started.
